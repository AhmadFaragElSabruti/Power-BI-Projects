🚗 The Power App Final Challenge 2025
This dashboard was the final part of the Parking Challenge where I had to build a complete Power Platform solution for Kontoso High School to manage parking more effectively.

My solution combined multiple Power Platform components to improve parking availability and reduce unauthorized use.
------------------------------------
🛠️ Solution Overview
I designed a system that included:

📊 Data Model with three Dataverse tables:
Vehicle
Parking Request
Parking Inspection
📱 Model-driven app: For staff and visitors to submit daily parking requests.
📲 Canvas app: For parking inspectors to log inspections and check unauthorized vehicles.
🔄 Power Automate flow: To automatically confirm parking requests.
📈 Power BI report: To analyze parking usage and provide management insights.

-----------------------------------
🎯 Challenge Objective

The goal was to create a complete solution that addressed the school’s parking issues by:

✅ Allowing staff and visitors to submit daily parking requests
✅ Enabling inspectors to verify parking spaces and detect unauthorized use
✅ Reducing unauthorized parking incidents
✅ Providing management with clear insights into parking trends and occupancy
✨ Key Takeaways

----------------------------------
This challenge allowed me to:

Integrate multiple Power Platform tools into one cohesive solution
Apply data modeling, app development, automation, and reporting in a real-world scenario
Demonstrate how Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI can work together to solve operational problems

---------------------
👨‍💻 I’m proud of this project because it shows how I can design end-to-end solutions that combine data, apps, automation, and analytics to deliver real impact.
